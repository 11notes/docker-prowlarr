Run Prowlarr smaller, lightweight and more secure

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will give you a rootless and lightweight Prowlarr installation. Prowlarr is an indexer manager/proxy built on the popular *arr .net/reactjs base stack to integrate with your various PVR apps. Prowlarr supports management of both Torrent Trackers and Usenet Indexers. It integrates seamlessly with Lidarr, Mylar3, Radarr, Readarr, and Sonarr offering complete management of your indexers with no per app Indexer setup required (we do it all).

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! All the other images on the market that do exactly the same don‚Äôt do or offer these options:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* This image runs as 1000:1000 by default, most other images run everything as root
>* This image is created via a secure, pinned CI/CD process and immune to upstream attacks, most other images have upstream dependencies that can be exploited
>* This image contains a proper health check that verifies the app is actually working, most other images have either no health check or only check if a port is open or ping works
>* This image works as read-only, most other images need to write files to the image filesystem
>* This repository has an auto update feature that will automatically build the latest version if released, most other providers don't do this
>* This image is smaller than most other images

If you value security, simplicity and the ability to interact with the maintainer and developer of an image. Using my images is a great start in that direction.

# COMPARISON üèÅ
Below you find a comparison between this image and the most used or original one.

| **image** | 11notes/prowlarr:1.35.1 | linuxserver/prowlarr:1.35.1 |
| ---: | :---: | :---: |
| **image size on disk** | 167MB | 181MB |
| **process UID/GID** | 1000/1000 | 0/0 |
| **distroless?** | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| **rootless?** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |


**Why is this image not distroless?** I would have loved to create a distroless, single binary image, sadly the way that Prowlarr is setup makes it really difficult to compile a static binary from source. Enabling AOT breaks almost 30% of used libraries because they are not setup to be statically linked (like Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location). It‚Äôs also not fixable with a single PR. This is something the Prowlarr team would need to do.

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [1.35.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/prowlarr/tags?name=1.35.1)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is of my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is super dangerous. Many times, I‚Äôve introduced **breaking** changes to my images. This would have messed up everything for some people. If you don‚Äôt want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:1.35.1``` you can use ```:1``` or ```:1.35```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!
